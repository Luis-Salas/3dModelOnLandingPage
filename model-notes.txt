If your model is not loading, here are some alternative approaches to try:

1. Install Blender and open your GLB file to check if it's valid
2. Try exporting your model from Blender to GLB format
3. Use a simple model for testing from these sites:
   - https://sketchfab.com/ (many free models)
   - https://market.pmnd.rs/ (simple models for Three.js)
   
4. For testing if your model path is working, try a different approach by directly loading a model from the web:

You could modify main.js to try loading a sample model from the web like this:

```javascript
// Try loading a sample model from the web
loader.load(
    'https://threejs.org/examples/models/gltf/Duck/glTF/Duck.gltf',
    function(gltf) {
        console.log('Sample duck model loaded!');
        mask = gltf.scene;
        scene.add(mask);
    }
);
```

Remember that once you get a model loading, you'll need to adjust the scale and position to fit your scene.
